player.py is for general testing
main.py is flask app file

CHANGES-
added player images to main.py and also MADE CHANGES TO THE HTML, HTML ONLY SHOWING REG Season STATS RN

Problems-
Some players like jalen green cant be pulled because they dont have the generic 01.html end.
    other players like jalen brown have 02.html
    find a way to fix this (Priority)

    start server: gunicorn main:app
        pip install -r requirements.txt && gunicorn main:app
